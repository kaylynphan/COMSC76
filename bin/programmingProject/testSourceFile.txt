LaHuffman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding character. Huffman codes are of variable-length, and prefix-free (no code is prefix of any other). Any prefix-free binary code can be visualized as a binary tree with the encoded characters stored at the leaves.
